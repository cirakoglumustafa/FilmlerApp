In this project, I used Xcode and Swift. I whipped up the interface using this cool tool called UIKit.
To keep track of movies and stuff, I made a little model class in Swift. It's got all the deets like the movie name, its pic, and how much it costs.
Now, to show off those movies in a fancy way, I went with this thing called a collection view. It makes everything look slick and organized.
Click on a movie and bam. You get this new screen with all the juicy details. You know, like the pic, name, and price.
